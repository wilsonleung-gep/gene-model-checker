Introduction
============

Before students can submit an annotation project to the [Genomics Education
Partnership](https://thegep.org) (GEP), they must first validate the gene models
and generate three additional data files for all the gene models in their
project \[i.e. a file in the General Feature Format (GFF), a file containing all
the transcript sequences, and a file containing all the predicted peptide
sequences\].

Based on the recommendations from GEP faculty members, we have created the
[*Gene Model
Checker*](https://gander.wustl.edu/%7ewilson/genechecker/index.html) tool to
assist annotators with their gene annotation efforts.

Please see the [*Gene Model Checker* User
Guide](https://community.gep.wustl.edu/repository/documentations/Gene_Model_Checker_User_Guide.pdf)
for an overview of the program, and some examples on how to use this program in
practice.



Availability
============

The [*Gene Model
Checker*](https://gander.wustl.edu/%7ewilson/genechecker/index.html) is
available under the "**Resources & Tools**" section of the [F Element project
page](https://thegep.org/felement/) and the [Pathways project
page](https://thegep.org/pathways/) on the GEP website.
